come here kussn :p u literaly put focus on u how do i even can loose u xD 
xD

it's the chat, so we can have chat without having to put comment everywhere 
or you can create a chat channel with live share
lets stay with me oh my.. i make soo many mistake when i type fast 

it's cuz you're tired
nah i just dont hit the right key i dont look at the keyboard xD

so i'll head to todo.txt and add everything we need to do

oh nice, i'll be able to test if things works too nice
https://amethyst-linea-38.tiiny.site xD  its only free for 7days btw ow
wait i have an idea

do you think it's enough for now?
we don'tt ned to think about everything right away yes u type alot 
xD



hey :p
so now, when we edit and save code, we put it on the repo online, and we can both get the same code :p nice 
we don't need to be always in a live share session if we want to edit it
so if one day you want to edit it
edit what you want, go on github desktop and:
add a meaning title (like what did you want to edit)
and in the descript, add what you did in details
then click commit
then puch origin
so i can get the code later :p nice 

wanna start? YEP lol

so we'll start by doing a basic landing html page, like btw can u go to dis?
title, main title etc
